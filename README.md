## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run my finance panel locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/finance-panel-boilerplate.git](https://github.com/Egv2/finance-panel-template.git)
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd finance-panel-boilerplate/frontend
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then, install the required npm packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will run on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can explore the various modules integrated into the dashboard:

- **Exchange Rates**: View current exchange rates and add or remove currencies as needed. Use the currency converter to perform real-time conversions.
- **Calendar**: Schedule and manage important financial events.
- **To-Do List**: Keep track of tasks and ensure nothing is overlooked.
- **Settings**: Customize the dashboard's appearance and functionality. Change themes, adjust font sizes, and toggle the visibility of the sidebar.

## Customization

The template is designed for flexibility. You can easily add or modify components to fit your project's needs:

- **Adding New Modules**: Create new components and integrate them into the sidebar navigation.
- **Styling**: Modify `styles.css` and `index.css` to change the appearance of the dashboard. Themes can be customized or additional themes can be added.
- **State Management**: Enhance or replace the current state management with libraries like Redux if your project scales.
